# Phishing Email Detection and Triage via Machine Learning and LLM-Driven Summaries
## Abstract
Phishing is one of the most prevailing and expensive type of cybersecurity threats, which has always exploited the trust of human beings to harvest their credentials, spread malware, or commit fraud with them. The traditional detection systems are completely relying on the static signatures or rule-based heuristic struggles to maintain their pace with the ever-evolving tactics which are used by the attackers. This method overwhelms the security analysts by creating high volume of false-positive flags. This research proposes a hybrid machine learning (ML) along with a large language model (LLM) approach to detect phishing emails and then automatically triage them for the review of the analysts. Therefore, at first, an ML classifier will be assigned to a quantitative “phishing risk score” which will be based on an engineered the header and content features. Secondly, an automated IoC extractor will be employed to identify suspicious URLs, domains, and attachments. Thirdly, an LLM (deepseek or GPT-4) will be used to generate concise, actionable summaries to highlight the key threats and their context. We hypothesize that this integrated system will achieve ≥95% detection accuracy, improve the IoC extraction recall to ≥90%, and will also reduce the average analyst triage time by at least 50%. Hence, a deployable microservice prototype will also demonstrate the real-world viability and will serve as a foundation for SOC integration in the future.
